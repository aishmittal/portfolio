  paraTwo: `I love to learn new things and prefer to work independently. I think that you 
    should not run towards success just <b>“KEEP LEARNING KEEP GROWING”</b> than success would definitely 
    follow you. Do the things you want don’t run behind others blindly. 
    Just enjoy your life and do whatever you want.`,

  I usually spent my free time on youtube watching videos related to history, technology and travel vlogs.`,
