    description: `
    This project was done as a part of 'Industry Oriented Problem' course. Smart Attendance Management System (SAMS) is a
    face identification based attendance management system which simplifies the attendance management procedure by
    taking images continually on a regular interval of time, marks attendance based on face identification and store the
    attendance records in a database which can be viewed later. The face identification model is generated after registering
    all the students of a subject and later on, this model is used for face identification. A Convolution Neural Network(CNN)
    model is built for face identification using keras library in python. User Interface is designed using PyQt python library
    while data is stored in a SQLite database.

    A smart mirror is basically a mirror with a screen behind it. That screen can be an android tablet or a computer monitor.
    The mirror is a two-way glass which is partially reflective and partially transparent. When one side of the mirror is brightly
    lit and the other is dark, it allows viewing from the darkened side and the people on the bright end side see their own
    reflection. The user interface is designed using PyQt Python library. Microsoft Cognitive Services are used for face
    identification and speech recognition while several other APIs are used for getting news, weather, stock prices and google
    maps. It can be powered by many devices such as a raspberry pi, your own unused laptop etc. It reduces the wastage of
    time where people getting ready for their office or for some other occasion who spent large time in front of mirror can do
    fruitful work such as getting to know today stocks prices, what kind of weather is going to be today, and Headlines of
    various kinds of news from different sources.

    Product-Info-Crawler is a python web crawler developed using scrapy framework. It has four spiders for 
    crawling the search results from olx.in, amazon.in, ebay.in and shopclues.com. The crawler extract the 
    product names, price, image urls, product urls and source and stores them in a csv file named results.csv. 
    It can be useful for comparing the price of a particular product between different e-commerce websites.

    Ultimate Maze is a game developed using UNITY 3D which involves solving the maze. The player has to control a tank
    and guide it to the end of the maze while avoiding certain obstacles in its path. The tank has been given certain powers
    such as Fire Canon and Water Gun by which it can destroy the obstacles in its path and complete the maze. There are
    certain collectable objects such as stars and sand clocks which increases the score and time respectively. In total there
    are 4 levels. The scripts are written C#.

    This project aims to develop a prototype of a voting machine that can be used to conduct elections at a small scale such
    as in institutes, unions and offices. The idea is to develop a simple processor-less circuit that can perform basic and some
    additional operations compared to a general voting machine. The absence of a processor makes it immune to tampering
    and increases the battery life of the prototype.

    description: `
    The main purpose of this project is to build a bot which follows a man or any other moving object closely using specificcolour
    tags or infrared LEDs. The main challenge was to track an object uniquely and in a wide field of view and follow it
    closely in a restricted manner and in all directions. It was not enough to track the presence of the desired object which
    was to be followed, but also its distance, orientation and do this continuously with a fast response speed. The major areas
    where man following bot will be useful is as a shopping cart which follows the customers automatically and also as a man
    following chair in libraries which follows readers as they move from one shelf to other.
